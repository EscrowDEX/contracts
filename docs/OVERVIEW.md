# **Decentralized Escrow Service - Overview**

## **1. What We Offer**
Our decentralized escrow service provides a secure way for buyers and sellers to transact on the blockchain without requiring trust between parties. Funds are held safely in a smart contract until both sides confirm the deal is complete.

## **2. Key Benefits**
- **Security**: Funds are protected until conditions are met
- **Transparency**: All transactions are verifiable on-chain
- **Fairness**: Built-in dispute resolution process
- **Flexibility**: Works with any ERC-20 token
- **Privacy**: Agreement terms are securely hashed, not stored in plain text

## **3. How It Works**

### **For Buyers**
1. Create a deal by specifying:
   - Seller's wallet address
   - Token and amount to escrow
   - Hashed version of your agreement terms
2. Funds are locked in escrow (minus 3% service fee)
3. Confirm receipt/service completion to release payment

### **For Sellers**
1. Review deal terms from buyer
2. Confirm agreement to the terms
3. Fulfill your part of the agreement
4. Receive payment automatically when buyer confirms

### **If There's a Dispute**
1. Either party can flag an issue
2. Our admin team reviews the case
3. Funds are distributed fairly based on the resolution

## **4. Why Our Solution Stands Out**

**Verifiable Agreements**  
All deal terms are converted to a unique cryptographic fingerprint (hash) that's stored on-chain. This ensures:
- No one can change the terms after agreement
- Both parties can prove what was originally agreed
- Sensitive details remain private

**Secure Fund Handling**  
- Funds are completely protected until both parties agree
- Automatic 30-day return if deal isn't completed
- Clear separation between escrow funds and service fees

**Simple Process**  
1. Agree on terms with your counterparty
2. Create escrow deal (takes <1 minute)
3. Confirm completion when satisfied
4. Funds transfer automatically

## **5. Current Features**

- Clear transaction history
- Instant verification of agreement terms
- Protected withdrawals to prevent errors

## **6. Ideal For**
- Freelancer payments
- Marketplace transactions
- Service agreements
- High-value purchases
- Cross-border deals
